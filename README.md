# Geospatial-Data-Analysis-using-Zomato-Restaurants-data
The project is about EDA with Geographic analysis and Interactive plots. Using Zomato Restaurants dataset from kaggle with 51717 entries, here I have analyzed data to find out area based restaurants, if they are top rated or if online delivery is available or not. In addition analyzed restaurants based on locations,
ratings, food types, offline/online service availability, different budget ranges and according to market cluster. Moreover, learnt the uses of the libraries, seaborn, plotly, folium, iplot, geopy etc.
