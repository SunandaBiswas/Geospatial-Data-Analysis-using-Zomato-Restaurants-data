# Geospatial-Data-Analysis-using-Zomato-Restaurants-data
The project is about EDA with Geographic analysis and Interactive plots. Here I have analyzed data to find out area based restaurants, if they are top rated or if online delivery is available or not. In addition analyzed the restaurant ratings, most served food items, food items in a specific budget and so on. Moreover, learnt the uses of the libraries, seaborn, plotly, folium, iplot, geopy etc.
